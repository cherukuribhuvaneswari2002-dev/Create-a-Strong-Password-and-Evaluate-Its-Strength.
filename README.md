**Password Strength Evaluation**
This project evaluates passwords of varying complexity using PasswordMeter.com to understand what makes a password strong and resistant to attacks.

**Key Steps:**

Created multiple passwords with different lengths and complexity.

Tested each password on PasswordMeter to get scores and feedback.

Compared results to identify best practices.

Researched common password attacks and how complexity impacts security.

**Findings:**

Long (12+ characters), random, and mixed-case passwords with numbers & symbols are strongest.

Common words or predictable patterns remain weak, even with substitutions.

Unique passwords for each account reduce risk from credential stuffing.

**Recommendation:**
Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
